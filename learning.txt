So far, Iâ€™ve learned how to use Git and GitHub effectively for version control and collaboration.
I understand the basics of cloning repositories, making changes locally, committing those changes,
and pushing them back to GitHub. I also learned how to work with branches, 
pull requests, and how to resolve merge conflicts.
